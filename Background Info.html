<p style="font-size:35px"/>The 8th Order started when Vader decided to join the order and then he renamed it the 8th order. There were 7 other orders but they were changed overtime. The first 3 orders fell because there was a lot of courruption within the system and the leaders could not get in an agreement of what they wanted to do with there internal problems. The 4-6th orders were changed overtime because there was no leader and the people where not able to corroperate/join the orders because there was a secret way to get into the order. The secret way to enter the society is to kill your parents and learn the ways of the jedi. Now that Darth vader has came to power in the 7th order there can be peace within the order. Vader changed the name to the 8th order because he believes that there can be peace with all people in the order.
